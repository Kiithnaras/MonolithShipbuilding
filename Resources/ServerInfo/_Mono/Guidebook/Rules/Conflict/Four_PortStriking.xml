# Conflict Rule 4
## Outpost striking is not allowed.
[bold]See the [textlink="Safe Zones rule" link="MonolithRuleRoleplayEightSafeZones"] for areas that are always protected from strikes.[/bold]

Faction outposts (e.g., [color=blue]Halcyon[/color]) are [color=red][bold]not allowed[/bold][/color] to be striked until the [color=yellow]4 hour mark[/color] in the Round has been reached (can be checked with your PDA), or if [color=yellow]admin permission[/color] has been given.
-- For clarity, a "strike" in this context refers to any (organized or unorganized) hostile action intended to damage outposts, seize control, eliminate its occupants, or damage docked ships that were not recently ([color=yellow][bold]2 minutes[/bold][/color]) in combat.
-- Action should be taken to avoid camping spawn areas inside the outposts if possible.

Mobile bases (e.g., [color=maroon]PDV Jupiter[/color]) do [color=red][bold]not[/bold][/color] fall under these rules.

[color=yellow]Ships are [bold]exempted[/bold] from this rule when they escape combat to their port. It is permitted to attack docked ships if they were in combat within the last two minutes, though you should [/color][color=red]minimize[/color][color=yellow] damage to the port itself.[/color]

[color=orange]Prison breaks[/color] from detained players both in and out of the faction do [color=red][bold]not[/bold][/color] fall under these rules.
-- [color=orange]Detained players[/color] can damage where they're being held, make a path to an exit forcefully, injure others, and steal ships from outposts to escape [bold]if necessary[/bold]. 
-- If anyone is killed, bodies should not be intentionally hidden or made unrecoverable. [bold]You do not[/bold] have to revive anyone. 
-- You should [color=red][bold]not[/bold][/color] be sabotaging an outpost. Such as cutting wires, destroying shields, generators, or gunnery consoles. Detained players may [color=red][bold]not[/bold][/color] get external help when escaping.
