# Conflict Rule 3
## Demands And Piracy

- Players must be given a reasonable time ([color=yellow][bold]at least 10 seconds[/bold][/color]) to react to demands before capture, serious injury, or death is inflicted in [bold]less-intense[/bold] conflict such as between Civilians and Factions/other Civilians.

- Use [color=green]roleplay[/color] and [color=green]escalation[/color]; avoid making impossible or unclear demands.
-- For example, saying "Give me your shuttle and ID!" [color=green]is a clear demand[/color]. Saying "GIVE ME EVERYTHING" is [color=red]not a clear demand[/color]. You must [bold]specify[/bold] what you want, like [color=yellow]Shuttles, money, ID's, armor, etc.[/color]

- Shipgun usage during [color=red]piracy[/color] should be a last resort, boarding methods should be prioritized and [color=yellow]EMP's[/color] can be utilized to assist in boarding.

- Players who are pirated should have a way to continue their gameplay. Although if they attack you, it is [color=red]not[/color] a requirement to revive them or bring them to medical personnel.
-- "Continue their gameplay" means leaving them a smaller shuttle, leaving them in space with a hardsuit, oxygen, and a radio to call for help, or keeping their thrusters and power source intact. Basically, [bold]leave a way for them to get back to civilization.[/bold]

[italics][color=green]You are allowed to stealthily board players ships without saying anything beforehand, but you cannot instantly attack people and must give them the chance to hand over goods.[/italics][/color]
