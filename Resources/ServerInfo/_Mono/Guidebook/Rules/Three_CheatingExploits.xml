# Core Rule 3
## Do not engage in cheating or exploits.

- [color=yellow]Report[/color] any discovered exploits to staff immediately via a Discord ticket or Ahelp.

- [color=red][bold]Do not use third-party software, macros, or any tools to circumvent game mechanics or gain an unfair advantage.[/bold][/color]
- [color=red]Exploiting bugs or unintended mechanics is not allowed.[/color]
-- [color=cyan]Subframing[/color] and other atmospherics-related bugs/glitches are also considered exploits, and fall under the same rulings.
-- [color=pink]Brain-swapping[/color] into other bodies to avoid turret detection, bypass station fund locks, and species restrictions such as Asakim armor being restricted to their species is a rulebreak.

[italic][color=green]Fair play is essential for a fun and balanced experience.[/color][/italic]
