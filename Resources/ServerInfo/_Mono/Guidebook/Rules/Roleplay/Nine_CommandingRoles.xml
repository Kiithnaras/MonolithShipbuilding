# Roleplay Rule 9
## Commanders have higher standards

[italics][color=yellow]Commanders are roles like Colonel, Grand Vizier, Overseer, and the Director of Care. Roles that are "next in line" to being a commander such as Asvarans and Captains also fall under this rule.[/color][/italics]

- Role abandonment is [color=red][bold]prohibited[/bold][/color] for commanding roles without any proper RP reasons.
-- This does [bold]not[/bold] include leaving the round in a cryopod or leaving after you died. 

- Giving out orders or doing actions that [bold]intentionally[/bold] harm your faction outpost or station are a rulebreak.

- Commanders should handle out [color=green]payrolls[/color] to lower ranks within the station or faction they're in command of. 
-- You can still pay yourself, but it should not be more than [color=green][bold]$50,000[/bold][/color] higher than the average pay you give out.

[color=green]Allowed examples[/color]:
-- Paying yourself $150,000 after giving 8 out of 10 of your workforce $100,000
-- A commander ordering someone to go on rogue silicon expeditions to get research and bluespace parts.
-- Leaving the game after you have died, or going into cryosleep & ghosting.

[color=red]Examples of rulebreaks[/color]:
-- The Director of Care helping borers spread on Medical Dispatch
-- A commander taking all the credits for themselves out of their funds.
-- A commander doing expeditions with no organized effort to lead their workforce.
