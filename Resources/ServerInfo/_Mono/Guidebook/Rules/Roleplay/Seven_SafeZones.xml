- Safe Zones are neutral and protect everyone unless you cause trouble.
- Do not steal ID's, ships, or supplies off of ships.
- Contraband is only actionable if used or if the contraband holder is causing trouble.
- Troublemakers are handed to CO Security Guards, not factions or groups.
- Use non-lethal force when practical; lethal force is acceptable if non-lethal would put you or others at serious risk.
