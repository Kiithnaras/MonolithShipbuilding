# Roleplay Rule 4
## Do not name yourself well known people or things.

[italics][color=green]You can always admin help for permission to use a name, you should do this when you're uncertain if a name is allowed.[/color][/italics]

- You should [color=red][bold]not[/bold][/color] be naming yourself after things that an average person would know about. Note that "things" mostly refers to popular memes, people, animals, etc. Not a name like "John" or "William"
-- Names such as Charlie Kirk, Harriet Tubman, Skibidi Toilet, and so on are a rule break.

- You should [bold][color=red]avoid[/color][/bold] making the name sound like the famous person, such as "Keyonu Reeves" or "Jo Byeden"

[italics][color=yellow]An admin can request you to change your name if they believe it sounds similar to something well known, their decision on this is final unless overridden by someone in a higher rank.[/color][/italics]
