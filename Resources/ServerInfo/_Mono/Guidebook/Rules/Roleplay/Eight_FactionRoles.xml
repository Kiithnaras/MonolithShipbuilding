# Roleplay Rule 8
## Faction Role Rules

[color=Red][bold]You should not be abandoning your role in a faction without valid RP reason[/bold][/color].

[color=yellow][bold]As a faction member, you should assume that:[/bold][/color]
- Your character is a mentally stable individual.
- Your character isn't part of any other groups that would take priority over your faction duties (such as religious groups, or acting under the orders of a company instead of your faction).
- You should listen to your superiors in most cases. This does not mean listen to your superiors when they order you to shoot a civilian without reason, and you should prioritize RP rules over this.

Various examples of [color=red][bold]Role Abandonment[/bold][/color] could be:

-- As PDV, willingly working with TSF despite no circumstances that would require it (further highlighted in Conflict Rule One).
-- Joining a faction only for its ships, gear, or access, and ignoring your duties to that faction (such as joining TSF/PDV and going out to do Botany). Your actions should be for the benefit of your faction and cause, not yourself.
