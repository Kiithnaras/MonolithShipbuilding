# Roleplay Rule 6
## Do not metagame.

[italic][color=green]Keep IC and OOC knowledge separate to ensure fair and immersive gameplay.[/color][/italic]

- Do not use [color=red]out-of-character (OOC) information[/color] to gain in-character (IC) advantages or knowledge.
-- Your character should only know what they have learned through [color=green]roleplay[/color] and in-game events.

- While metacomming (the act of communicating via external apps such as Discord voice-chats, Skype, Zoom, and OSRS) is [color=green]allowed[/color] normally, it is [color=red]not[/color] allowed during PVP combat, including [bold]ship combat and ground combat[/bold].  
-- Note that metacomming in PVE (Player V. Entity) combat is allowed under this rule. Player-controlled dungeon bosses are still considered entities under this rule.

[color=green]Allowed examples[/color]:
-- A player-controlled dungeon boss attacks you during an expedition. You metacomm with your crew to organize eachother.
-- Knowing faintly about Chimera, such as their kudzu tiles or infectious properties & the cure to revert Chimera.

[color=red]Examples of rulebreaks[/color]:
-- Communicating with others in a Discord channel during PVP combat to gain an advantage.
-- Having perfect knowledge of things that would be "rare" IC such as Asakim.
